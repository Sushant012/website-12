The 1st International Competition on Model Counting (MC 2020) is a competition to deepen the relationship between latest theoretical and practical development on the various model counting problems and their practical applications. It targets the problem of counting the number of models of a Boolean formula.

MC 2020 aims to identify new challenging benchmarks and to promote new solvers for the problem as well as to compare them with state-of-the-art solvers. The MC 2020 follows a direction in the community of constraint solving, where already many competitions have been organized such as on ASP (7 editions), CSP (19 editions), SAT (19 editions), SMT (14 editions), MaxSAT Evaluation (13 editions), QBF (8 editions).
