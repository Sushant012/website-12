TU Wien (Vienna University of Technology), TU Graz (Graz University of Technology), and JKU Linz (Johannes Kepler University), are seeking highly qualified candidates for the joint doctoral program on Logical Methods in Computer Science (LogiCS), funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF).

We are recruiting up to 12 doctoral candidates for a starting period of 3 years, with a negotiable starting date.

Deadline: June 12, 2020

The PhD program focuses on interdisciplinary research topics covering

- computational logic, and applications of logic to
- databases and artificial intelligence,
- computer-aided verification,
- security and privacy,
- cyber-physical systems, as well as to
- distributed systems.

### THE PROGRAM

Our PhD program LogiCS is focusing on logic and its applications in computer science. Successful applicants will work with and be mentored by leading researchers in the fields of computational logic, databases and knowledge representation, computer-aided verification, security and privacy, cyber-physical systems, and distributed systems.

The LogiCS doctoral program offers top research expertise, and a stimulating and supportive environment. The LogiCS is coordinated by TU Wien, which offers an outstanding research environment and numerous professional development opportunities. The Faculty of Informatics of TU Wien is the largest one in Austria and is consistently ranked among the best in Europe. The founding body of the LogiCS, the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), offers multiple funding opportunities for young researchers to advance their independent scientific careers.
