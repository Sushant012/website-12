I"<p>The 2020 SAT Competition is a competitive event for solvers of
the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem. It is organized as a
satellite event to the 23th International Conference on Theory
and Applications of Satisfiability Testing and stands in the
tradition of the yearly SAT Competitions, Races, and Challenges.
The deadline for submitting benchmarks and solvers is Tuesday
March 31, 2018 (23:59 GMT -12).</p>

<p>The area of SAT solving has seen tremendous progress over the
last years. E.g. many problems in hardware and software verification
that seemed to be completely out of reach a decade ago can now
be handled routinely. Besides new algorithms and better heuristics,
refined implementation techniques turned out to be vital for this
success.</p>

<p>To keep up the driving force in improving SAT solvers, we want to
motivate developers to present their work to a broader audience
and to compare it with that of others.</p>

<p>The 2020 SAT Competition will consist of the following tracks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Main Track (including a Glucose-Hack subtrack)</li>
  <li>Parallel Track</li>
  <li>Cloud Track (<strong>new</strong>)</li>
  <li>Incremental Track</li>
  <li>Planning Track (<strong>new</strong>)</li>
  <li>No-Limits Track</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Cloud track: Amazon Web Services is enabling and sponsoring a
“cloud track” for the SAT Competition in 2020. The solvers in this
track will run on 100 16-core computers each with 64GB RAM that
can communicate using standard protocols (ssh, MPI) with a timeout
of 1000 seconds (wall-clock time) per benchmark problem. Amazon
Web Services will provide $1000 in AWS credits for building and
evaluating solvers, which should be more than enough for development
and testing purposes. The benchmark suite will consists of hard
instances, both old (unsolvable instances from prior competitions)
and new ones, including formulas provided by AWS and participating
teams. <a href="https://satcompetition.github.io/2020/track_cloud.html">See details online</a></li>
  <li>Planning track: Apart from evaluating solvers on a broad range
of benchmarks, the SAT Competition will start with a track that is
dedicated to a single application of SAT solvers. The application
chosen for 2020 is Automated Planning. This track includes 100
satisfiable and 100 unsatisfiable formulas of varying size and
difficulty. All the formulas will encode either classical or HTN
(Hierarchical Task Network) planning problem instances using
several of the available encoding schemas.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="changes-incorporated-from-recent-competitions">Changes incorporated from recent competitions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>BYOB - Bring your own Benchmarks: each Main Track participant
(team) is required to submit 20 new benchmark instances (not seen in
previous competitions). At least 10 of those benchmarks should be
“interesting”: not too easy (i.e., not solved by MiniSat within
one minute on modern hardware) or too hard (unsolvable by the
participants own solver within one hour on a computer similar to
the nodes of the StarExec cluster).</li>
  <li>The solvers will ranked using the PAR-2 scheme: The score of a
solver is defined as the sum of all runtimes for solved instances +
2*timeout for unsolved instances, lowest score wins.</li>
</ul>
