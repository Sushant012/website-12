<p>Workshop proposals for SAT 2015 are solicited.  Both well-established
 workshops, possibly affiliated with other venues in previous
 editions, and new ones are encouraged.  Similarly, proposals for
 workshops with a tight focus on a core area within SAT, ranging from
 theory to applications, as well as those with a broader focus on SAT
 and related formalisms and paradigms, are welcome.</p>

<p>Please provide the following information in your proposal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Workshop title.</li>
  <li>Names and affiliations of organizers.</li>
  <li>Proposed workshop duration, from half a day to full day.</li>
  <li>Brief description of the goals and the scope of the workshop.</li>
  <li>Preliminary call-for-papers and program committee composition.</li>
  <li>Information of previous editions, if that applies (success, number
of submissions, number of participants, etc).</li>
  <li>Plans for publication.</li>
</ul>

<p>The workshop day is September 23rd. The main organizers of accepted
 workshops are expected to be present at SAT 2015. Should multiple
 proposals be submitted for similar workshops, possibilities of
 combining the workshops into one may be considered.</p>

<p>Should you have any questions regarding the calls, please contact us
via email using oliveras@cs.upc.edu.</p>
