<hr />

<p>The International Conference on Theory and Applications of
Satisfiability Testing (SAT) is the premier annual meeting for
researchers focusing on the theory and applications of the
propositional satisfiability problem, broadly construed. In addition
to plain propositional satisfiability, it also includes Boolean
optimization (such as MaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints),
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF), Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT), and Constraint Programming (CP) for problems with clear
connections to Boolean-level reasoning.</p>

<p>Many hard combinatorial problems can be tackled using SAT-based
techniques including problems that arise in Formal Verification,
Artificial Intelligence, Operations Research, Computational Biology,
Cryptography, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Mathematics, etc. Indeed,
the theoretical and practical advances in SAT research over the past
twenty years have contributed to making SAT technology an
indispensable tool in a variety of domains.</p>

<p>SAT 2019 aims to further advance the field by soliciting original
theoretical and practical contributions in these areas with a clear
connection to satisfiability. Specifically, SAT 2019 invites
scientific contributions addressing different aspects of SAT
interpreted in a broad sense, including (but not restricted to)
theoretical advances (such as exact algorithms, proof complexity, and
other complexity issues), practical search algorithms, knowledge
compilation, implementation-level details of SAT solvers and SAT-based
systems, problem encodings and reformulations, applications (including
both novel application domains and improvements to existing
approaches), as well as case studies and reports on findings based on
rigorous experimentation.</p>

<p>Early registration for both the conference and workshops is now available. We
encourage all potential attendees to register soon! After June 8, the prices
will increase! Registration can be done at the <a href="http://sat2019.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/registration.html">website of the
conference</a>.</p>

<p>The conference will take place at <a href="https://gulbenkian.pt/">FundaÃ§Ã£o Calouste
Gulbenkian</a>. Established in perpetuity, the
Foundationâ€™s main purpose is to improve the quality of life through art,
charity, science and education. The Foundation has a museum, which houses the
Founderâ€™s private collection, alongside a collection of modern and
contemporary art; an orchestra and a choir; an art library and archive; a
scientific research institute; and a garden, in a central area of the city of
Lisbon, where educational activities also take place.</p>

<p>More information about the venue and the social program of the conference can
be found <a href="http://sat2019.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/venue.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> The Summer School and the workshops will take place at the
<a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST/UL)</a> of the
<a href="https://www.ulisboa.pt/en/">University of Lisbon</a>.</p>

<p>Portugal is part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area">Schengen
area</a>. Please verify whether you
need a Schengen visa before your trip.</p>

<p>If you require a visa, we recommend contacting the nearest embassy, consulate,
or travel agency for information about the passport and visa requirements from
your country for entry to Portugal (Schengen). If you need an invitation
letter for visa purposes, then write in due time to
<a href="mailto:chairs@sat2019.tecnico.ulisboa.pt">chairs@sat2019.tecnico.ulisboa.pt</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we require the following information in order to avoid visa
fraud:</p>

<p><em>Students</em>: brief reference letter from your supervisor including contact
details for the University.</p>
