<h2 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h2>

<p>The purpose of the LaSh workshops is to foster scientific exchange on
subjects related to languages for representing, and methods for solving,
computationally challenging search problems.  The scope includes study of
relevant logics, algorithms, and logic-based systems, and also study of
other languages and systems from the viewpoint of logic, broadly construed.</p>

<p>Hard combinatorial search and optimization problems abound in science,
engineering, and other areas.  Examples include planning, scheduling and
configuration problems. Several communities have developed general purpose
solving technologies for such problems, supported by declarative modelling
or specification languages.  These include answer set programming (ASP)
from knowledge representation (KR), constraint solvers and modelling languages
from constraint programming (CP), and integer linear programming (ILP) solvers
and algebraic modelling languages from mathematical programming.  Other
relevant areas include propositional satisfiability (SAT), satisfiability
modulo theories (SMT), and representation languages based on classical
logic and FO(ID).</p>

<p>Differences in emphasis notwithstanding, these share the same purpose.
Indeed, there are many similarities in solving technologies, and increasing
exchange between the areas both in solving and representational issues.
From a logical point of view, whether a given language or system is
described in logical terms or not, we have languages which define some
class of structures, and systems whose purpose is to compute structures
in the class.  Logic may be seen as an explicit basis for building systems,
as an analytic tool, or as a formal approach to viewing the diversity of
systems more uniformly.</p>

<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>* Logics relevant to the study of search and optimization problems
* Languages for specifying or modelling search or optimization problems
* Reasoning about or with specifications of search problems
* Grounding and related language transformation methods
* Expressiveness and complexity of logics and languages
* Ground Solvers and their languages: SAT, ASP, SMT, FlatZinc, etc.
* New or extended ground solver languages: SAT+Cardinality, SAT+TC, etc.
* Design of systems, solvers, and related tools
* Approximation, tractable problem classes, etc.
* Proof systems and inference methods underlying solvers.
* Comparisons of different languages or methods
* Interesting applications, either as case studies or challenges
* Benchmark problems and instance collections

<h2 id="submission-information">SUBMISSION INFORMATION</h2>

<p>To encourage communication across areas, LaSh is a non-archival meeting.
In addition to new technical work, we welcome presentation of relevant material
which has appeared at conferences area-specific meetings or general conferences,
and also position papers, challenges, system descriptions and speculative work.</p>
