The Thirteenth International Workshop 
on Constraint Modelling and Reformulation

at the

20th International Conference on the Principles and Practice 
of Constraint Programming (CP 2014) in Lyon, France, on 
September (TBD), 2014.

<h2 id="aims-and-scope">Aims and Scope</h2>

<p>Constraint Programming (CP) is a powerful technology to model and
solve combinatorial problems, which are ubiquitous in academia and
industry. The last ten years or so have witnessed significant research
devoted to modelling and solving problems with constraints. CP is now
a mature field and has been successfully used for tackling a wide
range of real-life complex applications. However, such a technology is
currently accessible to only a small number of experts. For CP to be
more widely used by non-experts, more research effort is needed in
order to ease the use of the CP technology. We solicit original papers
that contribute to widen the use of the CP technology.</p>

<p>Workshop topics include (but are not limited to):</p>

<p>Application papers describing interesting problems and interesting
ways to model them;</p>

<p>Contributions to understanding modelling that could guide the manual
or automatic formulation of models;</p>

<p>Identification of the criteria that should be used in evaluating
models and the design of pragmatic techniques that facilitate the
choice and possibly combination among alternative models;</p>

<p>Design of higher-level modelling languages;</p>

<p>Automatic reformulation techniques.</p>

<p>The workshop will be held as a full-day or half-day workshop. Please
note that workshop-participants need to be registered for the
workshop. Past events of this workshop series can be found here
