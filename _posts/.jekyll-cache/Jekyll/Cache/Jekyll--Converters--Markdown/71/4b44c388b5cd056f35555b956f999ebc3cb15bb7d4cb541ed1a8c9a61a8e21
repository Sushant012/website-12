The RCRA group (Knowledge Representation &amp; Automated Reasoning) of the
       AI*IA (Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence)

                            organizes the

                         22nd RCRA workshop:
           Experimental evaluation of algorithms for solving
           problems with combinatorial explosion  (RCRA 2015)

                    Ferrara, Italy, September 21-22, 2015

* ______________________________________________________________________   *

This event follows the series of the RCRA (Knowledge Representation
and Automated Reasoning) annual meetings, held since 1994.
The success of the previous events shows that RCRA is becoming a major
forum for exchanging ideas and proposing experimentation methodologies
for algorithms in Artificial Intelligence.

<h3 id="aims-and-scope">AIMS AND SCOPE</h3>

<p>Many problems in Artificial Intelligence show an exponential explosion of the
  search space.  Although stemming from different research areas in AI, such
  problems are often addressed with algorithms that have a common goal: the
  effective exploration of huge state spaces.  Many algorithms developed in one
  research area are applicable to other problems, or can be hybridized with
  techniques in other areas. Artificial Intelligence tools often exploit or
  hybridize techniques developed by other research communities, such as
  Operations Research.
  In recent years, research in Artificial Intelligence has more and
  more focused on experimental evaluation of algorithms, the
  development of suitable methodologies for experimentation and
  analysis, the study of languages and the implementation of systems
  for the definition and solution of problems.</p>

<p>Scope of the workshop is fostering the cross-fertilization of ideas stemming
  from different areas, proposing benchmarks for new challenging problems,
  comparing models and algorithms from an experimental viewpoint, and, in
  general, comparing different approaches with respect to efficiency, problem
  modeling, and ease of development.</p>

<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Experimental evaluation of algorithms for
   o knowledge representation
   o automated reasoning
   o planning
   o scheduling
   o machine learning
   o model checking
   o boolean satisfiability (SAT)
   o constraint programming
   o argumentation
   o temporal reasoning
   o combinatorial optimization
   o quantified boolean formulae and quantified constraints
   o modal logics
   o logic programming
   o answer set programming 
   o ontological reasoning</li>
  <li>Definition and construction of benchmarks</li>
  <li>Experimentation methodologies</li>
  <li>Metaheuristics</li>
  <li>Algorithm hybridization</li>
  <li>Static analysis of combinatorial problems</li>
  <li>Languages and systems for definition and solution of problems</li>
  <li>Comparisons between systems and algorithms</li>
  <li>Application experiences (visualization, graphics, security, transports, …)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="submissions">SUBMISSIONS</h3>
<p>Authors are invited to submit either original (full or short) papers, or papers 
  that appear on conference proceedings.</p>

<p>Publications showing negative results are welcome, provided that the approach
  was original and very promising in principle, the experimentation was
  well-conducted, the results obtained were unforeseeable and gave important
  hints in the comprehension of the target problem, helping other researchers to
  avoid unsuccessful paths.</p>

<p>At the time of submission, authors are requested to clearly specify whether their
  submission is original or already published.</p>

<p>Workshop submissions must be in PDF format, do not exceed 15 (for full papers) or 
  8 (for short papers) pages, and should be written in LaTeX, using the LNCS style.</p>

<p>RCRA 2015 uses EasyChair for the submission of contributions. Details will be made available soon.</p>

<p>Submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee.</p>
