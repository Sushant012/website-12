<h3 id="motivation">MOTIVATION</h3>

<p>Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and related solver competitions organized during 
the last two decades have been a stimulating force to improve SAT solvers and 
related technologies. These competitions have encouraged developing novel 
algorithms, optimized implementation-level techniques and data structures to 
increase the practical performance and robustness of solvers. The competition 
benchmark suites are commonly used by the research community as the standard 
test set to evaluate progress. Additionally, the competitions provide large 
amounts of openly available data on solver performance on a large spectrum 
of benchmark families that encode important real and artificial combinatorial 
problems.</p>

<p>A lot more can be learned from these solver competitions than merely awarding 
and publishing the best-performing solvers. This special issue provides a venue 
to go beyond this, and welcomes research articles offering in-depth
understanding of different aspects of the SAT 2018 SAT competitions and
evaluation, inviting submissions describing solver techniques, benchmark 
families, competition reports, and thorough analysis and insights into the 
data produced by the competitions.</p>

<h3 id="topics-of-interest">TOPICS OF INTEREST</h3>

<p>Manuscripts addressing one or more of the following aspects related to the SAT 2018 competitions and evaluation are invited.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Articles (full or system descriptions) presenting details on the 
algorithmic and implementation-level aspects of original solvers with remarkable
performance during the SAT 2018 competitions and evaluation:â€¨
    <ul>
      <li>SAT Competition,</li>
      <li>Sparkle SAT Challenge</li>
      <li>MaxSAT Evaluation,</li>
      <li>QBFEval</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>as well as other FLoC Olympic Games 2018 competitions tightly connected with
Boolean satisfiability.</p>

<p>Remarkable is to be interpreted broadly, from good overall performance to very 
good performance on a specific set of benchmarks.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Full articles by competition organizers reporting on SAT 2018 competitions and 
evaluation. The articles should describe the competition, its criteria, why it 
is interesting to the SAT research community, execution environment used, 
analysis of the results (including how they compare to previous instantiations, 
if appropriate), and give a summary of the main technical contributions to 
the field, as well as discussions on lessons learned and suggestions for
improvements for future competitions.â€¨</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full articles presenting non-trivial in-depth analysis of the data produced by 
SAT 2018 competitions and evaluation. The articles should give novel insights 
into the competition data, analyzing for example the structure of competition
benchmarks and their relation to the effectiveness of different solver 
techniques in solving the benchmarks, scoring methods for ranking solvers, 
sensitivity of competition results, etc.â€¨</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full articles on new, relevant benchmark families submitted to the competitions, 
and related analysis of the competition benchmarks.â€¨</p>
  </li>
</ul>
