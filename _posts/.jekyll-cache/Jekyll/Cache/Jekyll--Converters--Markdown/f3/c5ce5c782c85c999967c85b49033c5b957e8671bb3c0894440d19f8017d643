<p>The International Conference on Theory and Applications of
Satisfiability Testing (SAT) is the premier annual meeting for
researchers focusing on the theory and applications of the
propositional satisfiability problem, broadly construed. In addition
to plain propositional satisfiability, it also includes Boolean
optimization (such as MaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints),
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF), Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT), and Constraint Programming (CP) for problems with clear
connections to Boolean-level reasoning.</p>

<p>We invite proposals for workshops associated to the main conference
program of SAT 2019, which will be held in Lisbon (Portugal) from July
7 to July 12, 2019.</p>
