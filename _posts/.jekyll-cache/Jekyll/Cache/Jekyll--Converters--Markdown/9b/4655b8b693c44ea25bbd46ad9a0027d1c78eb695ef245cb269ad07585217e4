<h2 id="aims-and-scope">AIMS AND SCOPE</h2>
<p>Since its introduction in the late 1980s, answer set programming (ASP)
 has been widely applied to various knowledge-intensive tasks and
 combinatorial search problems. ASP was found to be closely related to
 SAT, which has led to a method of computing answer sets using SAT
 solvers and techniques adapted from SAT. While this has been the most
 studied relationship which is currently extended towards
 satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), the relationship of ASP to other
 computing paradigms, such as constraint satisfaction, quantified
 boolean formulas (QBF), first-order logic (FOL), or FO(ID) logic is
 also the subject of active research. New methods of computing answer
 sets are being developed based on the relation between ASP and other
 paradigms, such as the use of pseudo-Boolean solvers, QBF solvers, FOL
 theorem provers, and CLP systems.
 Furthermore, the practical applications of ASP also foster work on
 multi-paradigm problem-solving, and in particular language and solver
 integration. The most prominent examples in this area currently are the
 integration of ASP with description logics (in the realm of the
 Semantic Web), constraint satisfaction, and general means of external
 computation.  This workshop will  facilitate the discussion about
 crossing the boundaries of current ASP techniques in theory, solving,
 and applications, in combination with or inspired by other computing
 paradigms.</p>
