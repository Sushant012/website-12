I"Û<p>We decided to create a game based on the SAT problem, which is available for Android and IOS in French and English.</p>

<p>We called this game <underline>SAT-Your-Day</underline>.</p>

<p><img src="https://combi.games/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/satYourDayStore.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>The problem is slightly different from the classic SAT problem because it is not a decision problem here.</p>

<p>The problem is to falsify as many literals as possible while ensuring that at least one literal per clause is true.</p>

<h2 id="the-rules-of-the-game">The rules of the game</h2>

<ul>
  <li>No box containing fruits should be empty.</li>
  <li>You must keep exactly one type of fruit per color.</li>
  <li>It is possible to have a box with several fruits in it.</li>
</ul>

<p>To link all of this to the SAT problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each box is a clause.</li>
  <li>Each color is a variable.</li>
  <li>Each fruit of a certain color is an assignment of a variable.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each level of difficulty, the number of boxes, colors and fruits will increase which will necessarily complicate the game.</p>

<p>Try to remove as much fruit as possible in our most difficult levels!</p>
