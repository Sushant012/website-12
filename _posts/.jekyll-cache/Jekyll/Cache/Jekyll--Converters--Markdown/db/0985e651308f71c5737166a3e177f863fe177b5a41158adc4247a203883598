<p>The International Conference on Theory and Applications of
Satisfiability Testing (SAT) is the premier annual meeting for
researchers focusing on the theory and applications of the
propositional satisfiability problem, broadly construed. In addition
to plain propositional satisfiability, it also includes Boolean
optimization (such as MaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints),
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF), Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT), and Constraint Programming (CP) for problems with clear
connections to Boolean-level reasoning.</p>

<p>Many hard combinatorial problems can be tackled using SAT-based
techniques including problems that arise in Formal Verification,
Artificial Intelligence, Operations Research, Computational Biology,
Cryptography, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Mathematics, et
cetera. Indeed, the theoretical and practical advances in SAT research
over the past twenty years have contributed to making SAT technology
an indispensable tool in a variety of domains.</p>

<p>SAT 2016 aims to further advance the field by soliciting original
theoretical and practical contributions in these areas with a clear
connection to Satisfiability. Specifically, SAT 2016 invites
scientific contributions addressing different aspects of SAT
interpreted in a broad sense, including (but not restricted to)
theoretical advances (such as exact algorithms, proof complexity, and
other complexity issues), practical search algorithms, knowledge
compilation, implementation-level details of SAT solvers and SAT-based
systems, problem encodings and reformulations, applications (including
both novel application domains and improvements to existing
approaches), as well as case studies and reports on findings based on
rigorous experimentation.</p>

<p>SAT 2016 takes place in the nice city of Bordeaux, which is located in
the South West of France.  Bordeaux is well-known to be the world wine
capital, and also ranked UNESCO town.</p>

<h1 id="scope">SCOPE</h1>

<p>SAT 2016 welcomes scientific contributions addressing different
aspects of the satisfiability problem, interpreted in a broad
sense. Domains include MaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints,
Quantified Boolean Formulae (QBF), Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT), as well as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). Topics
include, but are not restricted to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Theoretical advances (including exact algorithms, proof complexity,
  and other complexity issues);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Practical search algorithms;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowledge compilation;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implementation-level details of SAT solving tools and SAT-based
  systems;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Problem encodings and reformulations;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applications (including both novel applications domains and
  improvements to existing approaches);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Case studies and reports on insightful findings based on rigorous
  experimentation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="out-of-scope">OUT OF SCOPE</h1>

<p>Papers claiming to resolve a major long-standing open theoretical
question in Mathematics or Computer Science (such as those for which a
<a href="http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems">Millennium Prize is offered</a>, are outside the scope of
the conference because there is insufficient time in the schedule to
referee such papers; instead, such papers should be submitted to an
appropriate technical journal.</p>

<h1 id="paper-categories">PAPER CATEGORIES</h1>

<p>Submissions to SAT 2016 are solicited in three paper categories,
describing original contributions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>LONG PAPERS (9 to 15 pages, excluding references)</li>
  <li>SHORT PAPERS (up to 8 pages, excluding references)</li>
  <li>TOOL PAPERS (up to 6 pages, excluding references)</li>
</ul>

<p>LONG and SHORT papers should contain original research, with
sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the
contribution. For papers reporting experimental results, authors are
strongly encouraged to make their data and implementations available
with their submission. Submissions reporting on case studies are also
encouraged, and should describe details, weaknesses, and strengths in
sufficient depth. LONG papers and SHORT papers will be evaluated with
the same quality standards, and are expected to contain a similar
contribution per page ratio.</p>

<p>The authors should choose between a LONG or a SHORT paper depending on
the space they need to fully describe their contribution. The
classification between LONG and SHORT papers is mainly a way to
balance the workload of the reviewing process among PC members. It
also impacts the duration of the presentation of the work during the
conference. It is the responsibility of the authors to make sure that
their paper is self-contained in the chosen limit of pages. There will
be no requalification of the submissions by the PC.</p>

<p>TOOLS papers must obey to a specific content criteria in addition to
their size limit. A tool paper should describe the implemented tool and
its novel features.  Here ‚Äútools‚Äù are interpreted in a broad sense,
including descriptions of implemented solvers, preprocessors, etc., as
well as systems that exploit SAT solvers or their extensions to solve
interesting problem domains. A demonstration is expected to accompany
a tool presentation. Papers describing tools that have already been
presented previously are expected to contain significant and clear
enhancements to the tool.</p>

<p>Submissions should not be under review elsewhere nor be submitted
elsewhere while under review for SAT 2016, and should not consist of
previously published material.</p>

<p>Submissions not consistent with the above guidelines may be returned
without review.</p>

<p>Besides the paper itself, authors may submit a supplement consisting
of one file in the format of a gzipped tarball (.tar.gz or .tgz) or a
gzipped file (.gz) or a zip archive (.zip). Authors are encouraged to
submit a supplement when it will help reviewers evaluate the
paper. Supplements will be treated with the same degree of
confidentiality as the paper itself. For example, the supplement might
contain detailed proofs, examples, software, detailed experimental
data, or other material related to the submission. Individual
reviewers may or may not consult the supplementary material; the paper
itself should be self-contained.</p>

<p>Long and short papers may be considered for a best paper
award. If the main author is a student, both in terms of work and
writing, the paper may be considered for a best student-paper
award. Use the supplement to your submission to state (in a brief
cover letter) if the paper qualifies as a student paper.</p>

<p>Links to information on the Springer LNCS style are available through
the <a href="http://sat2016.labri.fr/">SAT 2016 website</a>.</p>

<p>All papers submissions are done exclusively via <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sat2016">EasyChair</a>.</p>

<p>One author of each accepted paper is expected to present it at the
conference.</p>

<h1 id="proceedings">PROCEEDINGS</h1>

<p>All accepted papers are expected to be published in the proceedings of
the conference, which will be published within the Springer LNCS
series.</p>

<h1 id="student-grants">STUDENT GRANTS</h1>

<p>A limited number of student travel support grants will be available
from our sponsors. Applicants should acquire a letter of support from
their advisor and prepare a statement detailing why the travel support
is needed. This information should be emailed to the SAT‚Äô16 conference
chairs at sat2016@easychair.org by March 31st, 2016. Determinations
will be made shortly after the notification to the authors.</p>
