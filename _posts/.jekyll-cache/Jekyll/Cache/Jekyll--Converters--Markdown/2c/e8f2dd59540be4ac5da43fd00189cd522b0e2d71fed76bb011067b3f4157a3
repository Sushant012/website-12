<h3 id="aims-and-scope">AIMS AND SCOPE</h3>

<p>Since its introduction in the late 1980s, Answer Set Programming (ASP) 
has been widely applied to various knowledge-intensive tasks and 
combinatorial search problems. ASP was found to be closely related to
SAT, which led to a new method of computing answer sets using SAT
solvers and techniques adapted from SAT. This has been a much
studied relationship, and is currently extended towards
satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). The relationship of ASP to other
computing paradigms, such as constraint satisfaction, quantified
Boolean formulas (QBF), Constraint Logic Programming (CLP), 
first-order logic (FOL), and FO(ID) is also the subject of active 
research. Consequently, new methods of computing answer sets are being 
developed based on relationships to these formalisms.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the practical applications of ASP also foster work on 
multi-paradigm problem-solving, and in particular language and solver 
integration. The most prominent examples in this area currently are 
the integration of ASP with description logics (in the realm of the
Semantic Web) and constraint satisfaction (which recently led to 
the Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP) research direction).</p>

<p>A large body of general results regarding ASP is available and 
several efficient ASP solvers have been implemented. However, there 
are still significant challenges in applying ASP to real life 
applications, and more interest in relating ASP to other computing 
paradigms is emerging. This workshop will provide opportunities for 
researchers to identify these challenges and to exchange ideas for 
overcoming them.</p>
