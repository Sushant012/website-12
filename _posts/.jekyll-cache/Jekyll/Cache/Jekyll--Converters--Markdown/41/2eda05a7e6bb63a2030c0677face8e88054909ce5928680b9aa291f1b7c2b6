<h2 id="important-dates">IMPORTANT DATES</h2>

<p>Submission to the special issue is now open.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Submission deadline:     December 12, 2014 (firm)</li>
  <li>First round reviews:     February 15, 2015</li>
  <li>Revision deadline:       April    15, 2015</li>
  <li>Final notifications:     June     15, 2015</li>
</ul>

<p>Final versions of accepted articles will be published online individually
as soon as received by the journal editors. The special issue will appear 
either as part of a regular volume or as a specific volume depending on the 
number of accepted papers.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">MOTIVATION</h2>

<p>Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and related solver competitions organized during 
the last two decades have been a stimulating force to improve SAT solvers and
related technologies.  These competitions have encouraged developing novel 
algorithms, optimized implementation-level techniques and data structures to 
increase the practical performance and robustness of solvers.  The competition 
benchmark suites are commonly used by the research community as the standard 
test set to evaluate progress.  Additionally, the competitions provide large 
amounts of openly available data on solver performance on a large spectrum of 
benchmark families that encode important real and artificial combinatorial
problems.</p>

<p>A lot more can be learned from these solver competitions than merely awarding 
and publishing the best-performing solvers. This special issue provides a venue 
to go beyond this, and welcomes research articles offering in-depth understanding 
of different aspects of the 2014 SAT-related solver competitions, inviting 
submissions describing solver techniques, benchmark families, competition reports, 
and thorough analysis and insights into the data produced by the competitions.</p>

<h2 id="topics-of-interest">TOPICS OF INTEREST</h2>

<p>Manuscripts addressing one or more of the following aspects of 2014 SAT-related
solver competitions are invited.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Articles (full or system descriptions) presenting details on the algorithmic
and implementation-level aspects of original solvers with remarkable performance
during the SAT-related competitions within FLoC Olympic Games 2014:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>SAT Competition,</li>
      <li>Configurable SAT Solver Challenge,</li>
      <li>MaxSAT Evaluation,</li>
      <li>QBF Gallery,</li>
      <li>Satisfiability Modulo Theories Competition,</li>
    </ul>

    <p>as well as other FLoC Olympic Games 2014 competitions tightly connected
with Boolean satisfiability, such as the Hardware Model Checking Competition.
Remarkable is to be interpreted broadly, from good overall performance to 
very good performance on a specific set of benchmarks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full articles by competition organizers reporting on SAT-related competitions 
within FLoC Olympic Games 2014. The articles should describe the competition, 
its criteria, why it is interesting to the SAT research community, execution 
environment used, analysis of the results (including how they compare to 
previous instantiations, if appropriate), and give a summary of the main 
technical contributions to the field, as well as discussions on lessons 
learned and suggestions for improvements for future competitions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full articles presenting non-trivial in-depth analysis of the data produced 
by SAT-related competitions within FLoC Olympic Games 2014. The articles 
should give novel insights into the competition data, analyzing for example 
the structure of competition benchmarks and their relation to the 
effectiveness of different solver techniques in solving the benchmarks, 
scoring methods for ranking solvers, sensitivity of competition results, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full articles on new, relevant benchmark families submitted to the 
competitions, and related analysis of the competition benchmarks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="submission-information">SUBMISSION INFORMATION</h2>

<p>Submissions should be written using the JSAT latex style files. System 
description submissions are limited to six pages in the JSAT style.
