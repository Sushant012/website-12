I"ã<p>This year, a new Sparkle SAT Challenge 2018 will be organised.</p>

<p>Sparkle SAT Challenge 2018 is a novel competitive event that leverages cutting-edge automatically constructed algorithm selectors to assess the state of the art in solving the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem, and to quantify contributions of individual solvers. The Sparkle challenge offers a chance for wide recognition for SAT solvers that perform well ‚Äúacross the board‚Äù, as well as for specialised solvers with excellent performance on specific types of instances.</p>

<p>The Sparkle challenge is organised in close cooperation with the 2018 SAT Competition.</p>
