<p>The International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT) is the premier annual meeting for researchers focusing on the theory and applications of the propositional satisfiability problem, broadly construed. In addition to plain propositional satisfiability, it also includes Boolean optimization (such as MaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints), Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), and Constraint Programming (CP) for problems with clear connections to Boolean-level reasoning.</p>

<p>We invite proposals for workshops associated to the main conference program of SAT 2017, which will be held in Melbourne (Australia) from August 28 to September 1, 2017, colocated with <a href="http://cp2017.a4cp.org">CP 2017</a> and <a href="http://iclp17.a4lp.org">ICLP 2017</a>, and following <a href="http://ijcai-17.org">IJCAI 2017</a>.</p>
