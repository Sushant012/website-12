I"<p>Programs for the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), i.e., SAT solvers, are nowadays used as core decision procedures for a wide range of combinatorial problems. Advances in SAT solving during the last 10â€“15 years have been spurred by yearly solver competitions. In this article, we report on the main SAT solver competition held in 2012, SAT Challenge 2012. Besides providing an overview of how SAT Challenge 2012 was organized, we present an in-depth analysis of key aspects of the results obtained during the competition.</p>
