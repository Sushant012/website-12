<p>Quantifiers play an important role in language extensions of many
logics.  The use of quantifiers often allows for a more succinct
encoding as it would be possible without quantifiers. However, the
introduction of quantifiers affects the complexity of the extended
formalism in general.  Consequently, theoretical results established
for the quantifier-free formalism may not directly be transferred to
the quantified case. Further, techniques successfully implemented in
reasoning tools for quantifier-free formulas cannot directly be lifted
to a quantified version.</p>

<p>The goal of the 2nd International Workshop on Quantification (QUANTIFY
2015) is to bring together researchers who investigate the impact of
quantification from a theoretical as well as from a practical point of
view. Quantification is a topic in different research areas such as in
SAT in terms of QBF, in CSP in terms of QCSP, in SMT, etc. This
workshop has the aim to provide an interdisciplinary forum where
researchers of various fields may exchange their experiences.</p>
