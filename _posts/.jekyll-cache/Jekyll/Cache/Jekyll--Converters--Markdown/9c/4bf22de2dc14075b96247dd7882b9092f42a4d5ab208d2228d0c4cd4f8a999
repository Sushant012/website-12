I"8<p>The MaxSat Evaluation is designed to provide a snapshot of current
progress in solving MaxSat by running submitted MaxSat solvers on a
heterogenous collection of benchmark instances.</p>

<p>MSE 2018 will be the 13th annual MaxSat Evaluation. We 
welcome contributions of two types from the community at large:</p>

<p>a) New MaxSAT benchmarks encoding instances of interesting
     NP-hard optimization problems, and</p>

<p>b) implementations of MaxSAT solvers that will be evaluated
    within MSE 2018 on a heterogenous collection of benchmarks.</p>
