<h2 id="aims-and-scope">AIMS AND SCOPE</h2>

<p>LPNMR 2015 is the thirteenth in the series of international meetings on
 logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. LPNMR is a forum for
 exchanging ideas on declarative logic programming, non-monotonic reasoning,
 and  knowledge representation. The aim of the conference is to facilitate
 interactions between researchers and practitioners interested in the
 design and implementation of logic-based programming languages and
 database systems, and those working in knowledge representation and
 nonmonotonic reasoning. LPNMR strives to encompass theoretical and
 experimental studies that have led or will lead to the construction of
 systems for declarative programming and knowledge representation, as well
 as their use in practical applications. This edition of LPNMR will feature
 several workshops, a special session dedicated to the 6th ASP Systems
 Competition, and will be collocated with the 4th Algorithmic Decision
 Theory Conference, ADT 2015. Joint LPNMR-ADT Doctoral Consortium will be
 a part of the program.</p>

<p>Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished
 research on all aspects of non-monotonic approaches in logic programming
 and knowledge representation. We invite submissions of both long and
 short papers.</p>

 appear in the conference proceedings published in the Springer-Verlag
 Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI/LNCS) series. At least one
 author of each accepted paper is expected to register for the conference
 to present the work. Submissions must be formatted according to the
 Springer LNCS author instructions,</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>         http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/Authors.html
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>must be written in English, and present original research. Paper
 submission will be electronic through the LPNMR-15 Easychair site:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lpnmr2015
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Two best papers of general AI interest will be invited for rapid 
 publication in the journal Artificial Intelligence - Journal - Elsevier. 
 Two best papers with narrower logic programming focus will be invited 
 for a rapid publication in the journal Theory and Practice of Logic 
 Programming.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-submission-policy">MULTIPLE SUBMISSION POLICY</h2>

<p>LPNMR 2015 will not accept any paper which, at the time of submission, is
 under review or has already been published or accepted for publication in
 a journal or another conference. Authors are also required not to submit
 their papers elsewhere during LPNMR’s review period. However, these
 restrictions do not apply to previous workshops with a limited audience
 and without archival proceedings.</p>

<h2 id="associated-events">ASSOCIATED EVENTS</h2>

<p>WORKSHOPS - LPNMR 2015 will include specialized workshops to be held on 
  September 27 prior to the main conference. Currently planned workshops 
  include:</p>

<p>ASP COMPETITION - A special session dedicated to a discussion of the
  6th ASP System Competition, including the methodology of the competition,
  benchmarks used, lessons learned and, most importantly, the results and
  the announcement of the winners.</p>

<p>ALGORITHMIC DECISION THEORY (ADT) 2015 (collocated - same time and place)
  Algorithmic Decision Theory is a vibrant and growing area of research
  concerned with algorithmic aspects of problems arising in social choice
  and economics that involve optimal ways to aggregate preferences. The
  area abounds in hard computational problems and may be an axciting area
  of applications for ASP. The two conferences will seek ways to identify
  and promote synergies between their respective areas of focus.</p>

<h2 id="venue">VENUE</h2>

<p>Lexington is a medium size, pleasant and quiet university town. It is 
 located in the heart of the so-called Bluegrass Region in Central Kentucky. 
 The city is surrounded by beautiful horse farms on green pastures dotted 
 with ponds and traditional architecture stables, and small race tracks, and 
 bordered by white or black fences. The Horse Museum is as beautifully 
 located as it is interesting. Overall, the city has a nice feel that mixes 
 well old and new. The conference will be held in the Hilton Lexington 
 Downtown hotel.</p>
