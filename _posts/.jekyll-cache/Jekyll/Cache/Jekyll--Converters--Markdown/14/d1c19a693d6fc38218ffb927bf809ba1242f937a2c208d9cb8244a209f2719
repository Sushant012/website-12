<h2 id="conference-scope">CONFERENCE SCOPE</h2>

<p>Since the first conference held in Marseilles in 1982, ICLP has been
the premier international conference for presenting research in logic
programming. Contributions are sought in all areas of logic programming,
including but not restricted to:</p>

<p>Theory: Semantic Foundations, Formalisms, Nonmonotonic Reasoning,
Knowledge Representation.</p>

<p>Implementation: Compilation, Virtual Machines, Parallelism, Constraint
Handling Rules and Tabling.</p>

<p>Environments: Program Analysis, Transformation, Validation,
Verification, Debugging, Profiling, Testing.</p>

<p>Language Issues: Concurrency, Objects, Coordination, Mobility, Higher
Order, Types, Modes, Assertions, Programming Techniques.</p>

<p>Related Paradigms: Inductive and Coinductive Logic Programming,
Constraint Logic Programming, Answer-Set Programming, SAT,
Constraints, Computational Argumentation, Abductive Logic Programming,
Functional Logic Programming.</p>

<p>Applications: Databases, Data Integration and Federation, Software
Engineering, Natural Language Processing, Web and Semantic Web,
Agents, Artificial Intelligence, Bioinformatics, Social Networks and
Social Choice.</p>

<p>In addition to the presentations of accepted papers, the technical
programme will include invited talks, advanced tutorials, the doctoral
consortium, the Prolog contest and several workshops.</p>
