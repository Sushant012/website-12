<ul>
  <li>Outstanding Master Thesis Award:  1200 EUR</li>
  <li>Outstanding Undergraduate Research (Bachelor) Award:  800 EUR</li>
  <li>The winners will be invited to present their work at an award ceremony in Vienna, Austria.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The degree must have been awarded between November 15th, 2017, and December 31st, 2018, (inclusive).</li>
  <li>Students who obtained their degree at TU Wien are excluded from the nomination.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="main-areas-of-interest">Main areas of interest</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Computational Logic, covering theoretical and mathematical foundations such as proof theory, model theory, computability theory, algorithmic lower and upper bounds, Boolean satisfiability (SAT), QBF, constraint satisfaction, satisfiability modulo theories, automated deduction (resolution, refutation, theorem proving), non-classical logics (substructural logics, multi-valued logics, deontic logics, modal and temporal logics), computational complexity and algorithms (complexity analysis, parameterized and exact algorithms, decomposition methods).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Databases and Artificial Intelligence, concerned with logical methods for modeling, storing, and drawing inferences from data and knowledge. This includes subjects like query languages based on logical concepts (Datalog, variants of SQL, XML, and SPARQL), novel database-theoretical methods (schema mappings, information extraction and integration), logic programming, knowledge representation and reasoning (ontologies, answer-set programming, belief change, inconsistency handling, argumentation, planning).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Verification, concerned with logical methods and automated tools for reasoning about the behavior and correctness of complex state-based systems such as software and hardware designs as well as hybrid systems. This ranges from model checking, program analysis and abstraction to new interdisciplinary areas such as fault localization, program repair, program synthesis, and the analysis of biological systems.</p>
