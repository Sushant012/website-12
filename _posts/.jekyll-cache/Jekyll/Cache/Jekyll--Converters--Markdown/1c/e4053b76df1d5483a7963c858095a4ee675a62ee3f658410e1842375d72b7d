I")<p>Based on the grant <a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/S015523/1">The next level of SAT solving for very hard problems</a> soon the details of the two RA positions will become available. For your information, here a rough outline:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at the highest possible pay level for such positions in the UK, running for 3 years, at Swansea University, in the <a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/science/computationalfoundry/">Computational Foundry</a></li>
  <li>project leader (PI) is Oliver Kullmann, the project is about the theory, implementation and application of Cube-and-Conquer (C&amp;C);</li>
  <li>“research assistant” (RA) means that the research is directed by the PI;</li>
  <li>one RA is for the connection to mathematics, and the mathematical applications;</li>
  <li>the other RA is for the SAT algorithms and its implementations (in C++17).</li>
</ul>

<p>Details to follow within the next 4-6 weeks.
If you are interested, please contact Oliver Kullmann, O.Kullmann@Swansea.ac.uk (subject title: C&amp;C).</p>
