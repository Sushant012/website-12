	      CALL FOR PAPERS
Journal of Automated Reasoning

       Special Issue On
 Automated Reasoning Systems
=================================================
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The past few decades have seen major developments and
practical achievements in automated reasoning systems. For
example, SAT solving has become an inherent part of the
standard hardware production process; SMT solvers are now
the backbone of most software verification techniques;
first-order theorem provers have pushed the productivity of
interactive theorem proving to a new level; computer algebra
systems have solved difficult problems in mathematics and
biology; knowledge representation systems have become
indispensable for reasoning in the world wide web; automatic
termination checkers routinely prove the termination of
complex programs.</p>

<p>This special issue is dedicated to automated reasoning
systems in their full variety along the following
dimensions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>considered logic: propositional (including (D)QBF),
first-order modulo theories, modal, temporal, decidable
fragments of larger logics, FOL, and HOL, â€¦;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>considered problem: satisfiability, interpolation,
quantifier elimination, consequence finding, model building,
reachability, termination, â€¦;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>application area: formal methods, artificial
intelligence, mathematics, biology, product development,
security, â€¦;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>user base: academic, educational, or industrial.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In particular, we welcome papers emphasizing engineering
aspects because, while often crucial for the success of
automated reasoning tools, they are typically not given a
sufficiently detailed treatment in theory papers or system
description papers published at conferences or workshops.</p>

<p>We welcome full-length papers describing past work not
previously published in a journal as well as papers of any
length describing new developments. Revised and enhanced
versions of papers published in conference proceedings that
have not appeared in archival journals are also eligible for
submission. All submissions will be reviewed according to
the usual standards of scholarship and originality.</p>

<p>We encourage submissions that include most, if not all, of
the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) theory details</li>
  <li>(ii) implementation details</li>
  <li>(iii) applications, and</li>
  <li>(iv) experiments.</li>
</ul>

<p>Papers should be in PDF format, following <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/theoretical+computer+science/journal/10817">JAR guidelines</a></p>

<p>and be submitted using <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jars2017">EasyChair</a></p>

<p>To encourage a speedy review cycle, we will expect authors
of submissions to serve as referees for other submissions as
needed.</p>
