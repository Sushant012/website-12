I"ï	<p>Multiple post-doctoral research positions available in the project on ‚ÄúProvably Verified and Explainable Probabilistic Reasoning,‚Äù led by the Principle Investigator, Kuldeep S. Meel. The positions are supported in part by the multi-million dollar NRF Fellowship for AI awarded to PI and additional funding from Defense Service Organization, Singapore.</p>

<p>The project broadly aims to develop of formal methods for AI techniques and employ advances in AI techniques for the development of formal methods. The project is sub-divided into the following four major themes whose detailed description is available at MeelGroup Research.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Theme 1: Revisiting NP Revolution: New Paradigms for SAT/SMT/MaxSAT Solvers</li>
  <li>Theme 2: Constrained Sampling and Integration/Counting</li>
  <li>Theme 3: Verification of AI Systems</li>
  <li>Theme 4: Interpretable and Explainable Explanations for AI Systems</li>
</ul>
