I"ç<p>Stamford, CT, U.S.A. September 30 to October 4, 2019 The 25th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming</p>

<p>For the fourth consecutive year, the organizers of CP 2019 are seeking to extend the scope of the conference through themed tracks. Of particular interest are topics that are potentially relevant to the CP/AI/computer science community, even if they do not directly involve constraint programming. Both repeat tracks and new tracks are welcome. CP 2019 will also include technical and applications tracks as in previous years.</p>

<p>Tracks at recent meetings have covered biology, machine learning and data sciences, operations research &amp; mathematical programming, satisfiability, testing &amp; verification, music, multi-agent and parallel CP, power systems management, computational sustainability, and social choice theory. Proposals for additional topics are enthusiastically encouraged, whether they involve methodology, software, or specific application areas.</p>

<p>The conference will provide track participants an opportunity to learn about the latest trends and attend tutorials in constraint programming, a powerful technology that is rapidly being adopted by industry. Papers accepted for presentation will be published in the Springer LNCS conference proceedings, which are distributed at the time of the conference.</p>

<p>Proposals are invited from potential track chairs, who will be expected to recruit a small program committee (5 to 10 individuals) to review submissions. The chair(s) of the proposed track should reasonably expect to receive at least a half dozen submissions, some of which can be individually solicited if desired. They will also serve as members of the Senior Program Committee, which will discuss final acceptance decisions via EasyChair in late June 2019.</p>

<p>Potential chairs are encouraged to contact the CP 2019 Program Chair and co-Chair, Thomas Schiex (Thomas.Schiex@inra.fr) and Simon de Givry (Simon.de-Givry@inra.fr) to propose a topic or discuss ideas for topics. We would like to finalize the list of tracks by January 25 so that a timely call for papers can be issued.</p>
