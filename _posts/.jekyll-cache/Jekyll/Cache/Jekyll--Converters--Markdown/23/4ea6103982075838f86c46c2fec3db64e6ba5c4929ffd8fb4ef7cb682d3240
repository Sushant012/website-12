<p>So far we did not receive many new benchmarks. If you are using MaxSAT
to solve problems, we encourage you to submit your formulas to this
year MaxSAT Evaluation.
New benchmarks are critical for the continuous improvement of MaxSAT
solvers and to perform a better assessment of their performance.</p>
