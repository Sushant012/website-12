<h2 id="scope">SCOPE</h2>

<p>Craig interpolation enjoys a continuing popularity in computer
science. Historically, Craigâ€™s interpolation theorem has received
ample attention in proof theory and mathematical logic as well as in
complexity theory. Recently, interpolants are increasingly used in
automated verification, synthesis, and description logics. The aim of
the workshop is to bring together theoreticians and practitioners from
these different fields.</p>

<p>We solicit submissions in form of an abstract of at most one page in
PDF format. The authors of accepted abstracts are required to
present their work at the workshop. There will be no published
proceedings.</p>

<p>We encourage submissions presenting work in progress, tools under
development, as well as research of PhD students, such that the
workshop can become a forum for active dialog between the groups
involved in applications of interpolation. We also encourage
contributions from outside the verification community.</p>

<p>Presentations of recently published papers are also allowed and
encouraged, but please indicate on your submission where the paper was
published/presented.</p>

<p>Relevant topics include (but are not limited to) applications of
interpolation in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interpolating decision procedures</li>
  <li>Proof theoretic approaches to interpolation</li>
  <li>Proof systems and calculi for interpolation</li>
  <li>Proof transformation techniques</li>
  <li>Inductive Proofs</li>
  <li>Logical Abduction</li>
  <li>Interpolation techniques based on constraint solving, linear programmingâ€¦</li>
  <li>Alternative techniques for interpolation</li>
  <li>Interpolation theorems (for theories and extensions, non-classical
logic, â€¦)</li>
  <li>Interpolation-based/Inductive invariant generation</li>
  <li>Program analysis and verification</li>
  <li>Tools for interpolation</li>
  <li>Applications of Craig interpolation (verification, synthesis,

  <li>Forgetting, variable elimination, and uniform interpolation</li>
  <li>Complexity results and limitations
â€¦</li>
</ul>
