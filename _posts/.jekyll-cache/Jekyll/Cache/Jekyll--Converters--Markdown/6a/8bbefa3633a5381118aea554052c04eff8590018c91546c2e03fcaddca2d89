<p>AiML-2016:  2ND CALL FOR PAPERS</p>

<p>11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN MODAL LOGIC
BUDAPEST, 29 AUGUST ‚Äì 2 SEPTEMBER 2016</p>

<p>Advances in Modal Logic is an initiative aimed at presenting
the state of the art in modal logic and its various applications. The
initiative consists of a conference series together with volumes based 
on the conferences. Information about the AiML series can be obtained 
at http://www.aiml.net. AiML-2016 is the 11th conference in the series.</p>

<p>TOPICS
We invite submission on all aspects of modal logic, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>history of modal logic</li>
  <li>philosophy of modal logic</li>
  <li>applications of modal logic</li>
  <li>computational aspects of modal logic (complexity and decidability of
 modal and temporal logics, modal and temporal logic programming,
 model checking, model generation, theorem proving for modal logics)</li>
  <li>theoretical aspects of modal logic (algebraic/categorical perspectives
 on modal logic, coalgebraic modal logic, completeness and canonicity,
 correspondence and duality theory, many-dimensional modal logics,
 modal fixed point logics, model theory of modal logic, proof theory
 of modal logic)</li>
  <li>specific instances and variations of modal logic (description logics,
 modal logics over non-boolean bases, dynamic logics and other process
 logics, epistemic and deontic logics, modal logics for agent-based
 systems, modal logic and game theory, modal logic and grammar
 formalisms, provability and interpretability logics, spatial and
 temporal logics, hybrid logic, intuitionistic logic, substructural
 logics, computationally light fragments of all such logics)</li>
</ul>

<p>Papers on related subjects will also be considered.</p>

<p>PAPER SUBMISSIONS
There will be two types of submissions to AiML-2016:</p>

<p>(1) Full papers for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the
conference.</p>

<p>(2) Short presentations intended for presentation at the conference
but not for the published proceedings.</p>

<p>Both types of papers should be submitted electronically using the
EasyChair submission page at</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aiml16
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At least one author of each accepted paper or short presentation must
register for and attend the conference.</p>

<p>(1) FULL PAPERS
Authors are invited to submit, for presentation at the conference and
publication in the proceedings, full papers reporting on original 
research and not submitted elsewhere. The proceedings of AiML-2016 will 
be published by College Publications</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>       http://www.collegepublications.co.uk
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>in a volume to be made available at the conference.</p>

<p>The submissions should be at most 15 pages, with an optional technical
appendix of up to 5 pages, together with a plain-text abstract of 
100-200 words. The submissions must be typeset in LaTeX, using the style 
files and template that will be provided on the AiML-2016 website
http://phil.elte.hu/aiml2016/ in due time.</p>

<p>We also ask authors of full papers to submit the abstract in plain 
text via EasyChair by 10 March.</p>

<p>(2) SHORT PRESENTATIONS.
These should be at most 5 pages. They may describe preliminary
results, work in progress etc., and will be subject to light reviewing. 
The accepted submissions will be made available at the conference, and the
authors will have the opportunity to give short presentations 
(of up to 15 minutes) on them.</p>
