The Department of Computer Science at Lund University invites applications for postdoc and PhD positions focused on SAT solving and combinatorial optimization. The postdocs and PhD students will be working in the research group of Jakob Nordström, which is currently in transition from KTH to a combined location at Lund University and the University of Copenhagen on either side of the Oresund bridge.

Much of the activities of the research group revolve around the themes of efficient algorithms for satisfiability in propositional logic (SAT solving) and lower bounds on the efficiency of methods for reasoning about SAT (proof complexity). On the practical side, one problem of interest is to gain a better understanding of, and improve, the performance of current state-of-the-art SAT solvers based on conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL). We are even more interested in exploring new algebraic or geometric techniques (such as Groebner bases or pseudo-Boolean solving) that could potentially yield exponential improvements over CDCL. We also believe that there should be ample room for technology transfer with related areas such as SMT solving, constraint programming (CP), and/or mixed integer linear programming (MIP), and so the research project will likely involve such areas.
 
The application deadline is February 10, 2020. See the [PostDoc](http://www.csc.kth.se/~jakobn/openings/Postdoc-SAT-LTH-200210.php) and [PhD](http://www.csc.kth.se/~jakobn/openings/PhD-SAT-LTH-200210.php) full announcements for more information and instructions how to apply. Informal enquiries are welcome and may be sent to jakob.nordstrom@cs.lth.se or jn@di.ku.dk .
